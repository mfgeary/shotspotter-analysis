# Analysis of Chicago ShotSpotter data

This is an analysis of data from the gun detection technology, ShotSpotter, in Chicago. This analysis was performed by the Wheaton College Applied Topics in Mathetmatics class, led by Dr. Paul Isihara. In this analysis, we compared gun detection data from ShotSpotter with data from the Chicago Police Department regarding shooting events.

Our main analysis consisted of linking CPD shooting events with ShotSpotter events and assessing the likelihood of linkage for ShotSpotter events. We found that linkage was not a good indicator of whether a shooting event with a CPD response had occurred. Further, linkage was not a good indicator of whether the CPD made an arrest at a shooting event.
